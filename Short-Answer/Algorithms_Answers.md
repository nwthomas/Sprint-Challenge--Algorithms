## Exercise I

a)

b)

c) The _if/then_ block within this code is irrelevant as it's constant time. The meat of this function is the recursive call; once again, the number 2 is irrelevant in the face of the recursive call. This function is a running time complexity of `O(n)` due to iterating a recursive call once for every number from n to 0.

## Exercise II
